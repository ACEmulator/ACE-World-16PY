The Sleeping One was still alone and though it had succeeded in bringing life it had failed to create what it had wanted. There were no beings that thought like it, could call to it or ask it for guidance. So it pulled two seeds from the nether and planted each into the soil of the Bur. It watched as the seeds grew into life and began to swim through the muck of the Bur and then leap from the muck to the muloo or walk amongst the iallootu. Brothers born of its flesh, the Fiazhat and the Burun.

Come. Come. The false gods begged of the Fiazhat. But Fiazhar brothers could not see the lithe forms whose delicate faces were filled with wrath. Only the mucor saw the truth and saw these forms, heard their songs and felt their passage. So it was that the Burun knew of these beings, these false ones.
